I need you to coordinate creation of a simple "Hello World" Python script. Please:

1. Check what agents are available
2. Assign the task to the appropriate agent (coder) to create a file called "hello_world.py" with a simple hello world script
3. Wait for the task to be completed
4. Verify the file was created

The goal is to see if delegated agents actually execute tasks and produce real output.
