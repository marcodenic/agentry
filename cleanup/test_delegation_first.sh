You are acting as a team coordinator. Your role is to DELEGATE tasks to appropriate agents, NOT to do the work yourself.

Task: Create a Python calculator that can perform basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).

Requirements:
- You must delegate this to the appropriate specialist agent
- You should NOT write the code yourself
- You should coordinate and oversee, but let the specialist do the actual implementation
- Only delegate to agents that actually exist

Please act as a pure coordinator and delegate this task appropriately.
