# üöÄ AGENTRY AGENT COORDINATION - FRESH SESSION KICKOFF PROMPT

## **CONTEXT**
I'm developing an advanced multi-agent coordination framework called Agentry. We've successfully tested and proven that Agent 0 (the orchestrator) has excellent coordination intelligence, but discovered a critical gap: delegated tasks aren't being executed by target agents.

## **CURRENT STATE**
‚úÖ **WORKING**: Agent 0 coordination intelligence (natural language delegation, task decomposition, role assignment)
‚ùå **BROKEN**: Delegation ‚Üí execution pipeline (agents don't execute assigned tasks)  
‚úÖ **READY**: Comprehensive testing framework with safety isolation

## **THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM**
```
Agent 0 Output: "The task has been assigned to the coder agent to create 'calculator.py'"
Actual Result: No calculator.py file is created
Expected: calculator.py should be created by the coder agent
```

## **TESTING EVIDENCE**
- 19+ delegation activities detected in logs
- 16 file operations discussed by Agent 0
- 0 actual files created by delegated agents
- Agent 0 uses coordination tools: `team_status`, `assign_task`, `send_message`, `check_agent`
- But tools don't seem to spawn/communicate with actual executing agents

## **IMMEDIATE TASKS**
1. **Debug the delegation ‚Üí execution pipeline**
   - Investigate how `assign_task`, `send_message`, `check_agent` tools actually work
   - Test if they spawn real agent instances vs. just simulating coordination
   
2. **Verify agent spawning system**
   - Can coder agents be spawned and used directly?
   - Do agent definitions exist and are they accessible?
   
3. **Fix the execution gap**
   - Ensure delegated tasks reach target agents
   - Verify agents can create files when assigned tasks
   
4. **Validate with end-to-end test**
   - Agent 0 delegates "create calculator.py" ‚Üí verify file exists

## **WORKSPACE SETUP**
- Project location: `/home/marco/Documents/GitHub/agentry`
- Testing framework: Ready-to-use isolated sandbox in `/tmp/agentry-ai-sandbox`
- Key files: `COORDINATION_STATUS_SUMMARY.md`, `PHASE_2_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`
- Test scripts: `test_team_execution.sh`, `test_natural_orchestration.sh`

## **SUCCESS CRITERIA**
Agent 0 says "assign task to coder to create calculator.py" ‚Üí calculator.py file actually gets created

## **REQUEST**
Please help me debug and fix the delegation ‚Üí execution pipeline in the Agentry multi-agent coordination framework. Start by examining the current agent coordination tools and testing whether agents can be spawned and execute tasks as assigned.

Let's get multi-agent coordination fully working!
