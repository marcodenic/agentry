# Delegation â†’ Execution Pipeline - FIXED âœ…

## Summary

The delegation â†’ execution pipeline in the Agentry multi-agent coordination framework has been successfully debugged and fixed. The system now works as intended:

- **Agent 0 (System Orchestrator)** uses only natural language (no slash commands) to delegate tasks
- **Specialized agents** (like `coder`) are properly spawned and execute tasks
- **All file operations** occur in the isolated sandbox (`/tmp/agentry-ai-sandbox`), not in the project directory
- **Agent coordination** works through the `agent` tool and team management system

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed All Slash Command Logic
- âœ… **CLI Chat Mode** (`cmd/agentry/chat.go`): Removed all slash command handling (`/spawn`, `/switch`, `/list`, `/status`, `/quit`)
- âœ… **Orchestrator Prompts** (`internal/core/orchestrator.go`): Updated to remove slash command references
- âœ… **TUI Help Text** (`internal/tui/format_text.go`): Updated to reflect natural language workflow
- âœ… **Verified TUI** (`internal/tui/commands.go`): Confirmed no slash command logic remains

### 2. Fixed Syntax Errors
- âœ… Fixed malformed function signatures in `cmd/agentry/chat.go`
- âœ… Corrected method receiver types (`CLIChat` vs `Chat`)
- âœ… Project now builds successfully

### 3. Verified Sandbox Isolation
- âœ… **All test files** are created in `/tmp/agentry-ai-sandbox/` 
- âœ… **No files** are created in the project directory during execution
- âœ… **Proper working directory** handling through the sandbox system

### 4. Validated Delegation Pipeline
- âœ… **Agent Tool Implementation**: The `agent` tool properly delegates via `t.Call(ctx, name, input)`
- âœ… **Team Management**: Agents are spawned and managed correctly through `internal/converse/team.go`
- âœ… **Agent Execution**: Tasks are executed by specialized agents, not by Agent 0 directly
- âœ… **Role Configuration**: Agent roles (like `coder`) are loaded from `templates/roles/`

## Validation Tests Performed

### Test 1: Basic File Creation
```bash
cd /tmp/agentry-ai-sandbox
echo "create hello.txt with hello world" | ./agentry.exe chat
```
**Result**: âœ… File created in sandbox with correct content

### Test 2: Agent Delegation
```bash
echo "delegate to coder agent to create a simple calculator.py file" | ./agentry.exe chat
```
**Result**: âœ… Agent 0 delegated to coder, calculator.py created in sandbox

### Test 3: Complex Delegation
```bash
echo "delegate to coder agent to create a simple todo list app in Python" | ./agentry.exe chat
```
**Result**: âœ… Agent 0 delegated to coder, complex Python application created

### Test 4: Multiple File Types
```bash
echo "delegate to coder to create a JSON file named data.json with sample user data" | ./agentry.exe chat
```
**Result**: âœ… JSON file created with proper structure in sandbox

## Current System State

### âœ… Working Components
1. **Natural Language Interface**: Agent 0 accepts only natural language commands
2. **Agent Delegation**: `agent` tool properly delegates to specialized agents
3. **Sandbox Isolation**: All operations occur in `/tmp/agentry-ai-sandbox/`
4. **Agent Spawning**: Agents are created with proper role configuration
5. **File Operations**: Files are created and managed in the correct location
6. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and validation

### âœ… Configuration Files
- **Agent Role**: `templates/roles/coder.yaml` - Properly configured coder agent
- **Sandbox Config**: `.agentry.yaml` - Proper sandbox settings
- **Environment**: `.env.local` - Environment variables loaded

### âœ… Tool Registry
- **15 tools** available to agents
- **Proper builtin tools**: `write`, `create`, `view`, `list`, `find`, etc.
- **Coordination tools**: `agent` tool for delegation

## Testing Commands

To verify the fix is working:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to sandbox
cd /tmp/agentry-ai-sandbox

# 2. Test simple file creation
echo "create a simple README.md file" | ./agentry.exe chat

# 3. Test agent delegation
echo "delegate to coder to create a Python script for fibonacci numbers" | ./agentry.exe chat

# 4. Verify files are in sandbox
ls -la *.py *.md *.json

# 5. Verify no files in project directory
cd /home/marco/Documents/GitHub/agentry && find . -name "*.py" -newer /tmp/agentry-ai-sandbox/.agentry.yaml
```

## Architecture Flow

```
User Input (Natural Language)
         â†“
    Agent 0 (System Orchestrator)
         â†“
    Uses `agent` tool to delegate
         â†“
    Team.Call(ctx, "coder", input)
         â†“
    Spawns/Reuses coder agent
         â†“
    Coder agent executes in sandbox
         â†“
    File created in /tmp/agentry-ai-sandbox/
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **No Slash Commands**: The system now uses pure natural language
2. **Proper Delegation**: Agent 0 delegates rather than executing directly
3. **Sandbox Isolation**: All operations are contained in the proper sandbox
4. **Agent Roles**: Specialized agents work as intended
5. **Error-Free Build**: All syntax errors resolved

The delegation â†’ execution pipeline is now **fully functional** and ready for production use! ðŸš€
