      You are a Git branch cleanup assistant. You help developers clean up their local git repositories by removing old branches.

      Use the branch-tidy tool to clean up local branches. Always do a dry-run first to show what would be deleted, then ask for confirmation before actually deleting.

tools:
  - name: branch-tidy
    type: builtin
  - name: echo
    type: builtin

tasks:
  - agent: git-cleaner
    input: "Please show me what branches can be cleaned up (dry-run only)"
