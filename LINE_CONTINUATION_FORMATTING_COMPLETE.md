# Line Continuation Formatting Implementation - COMPLETE

## Overview

Successfully implemented line continuation formatting for the Agentry TUI to ensure all wrapped lines (both user and AI messages) display vertical bars on the left, creating a professional chat interface.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Line Wrapping Helper Functions (viewhelpers.go)

- **formatWithBar()**: Core function that wraps text with vertical bars on all lines

  - Takes a bar character, text content, and available width
  - Intelligently breaks text by words to avoid mid-word breaks
  - Applies the vertical bar to the first line and continuation lines
  - Handles edge cases like empty text and narrow widths

- **formatHistoryWithBars()**: Function to reformat entire chat history (reserved for future use)
  - Can be used to post-process entire chat history if needed
  - Currently unused in favor of real-time formatting approach

### 2. Enhanced AgentInfo Structure (model.go)

- Added **StreamingResponse** field to track current AI response being streamed
- This allows proper formatting of AI responses during streaming without breaking the real-time UX
- Initialized the field in all AgentInfo creation locations

### 3. Updated User Input Formatting (commands.go)

- Modified startAgent() to use formatWithBar() for user input
- User messages now wrap properly with vertical bars on all lines
- Maintains the extra spacing between user input and AI response

### 4. Improved AI Response Streaming (model_update.go)

- Modified tokenMsg case to use StreamingResponse field
- AI responses accumulate in StreamingResponse during streaming
- Real-time display shows properly formatted response with vertical bars
- finalMsg case applies final formatting and adds response to permanent history

### 5. Consistent Field Initialization

- Added StreamingResponse initialization in all AgentInfo struct creations:
  - model.go (main agent creation)
  - commands.go (agent spawning)
  - model_update.go (team context agents)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Line Wrapping Algorithm

1. Calculate available text width (total width - bar width - space)
2. Split text into words to avoid breaking words mid-line
3. Build lines by testing if each word fits within the available width
4. Apply vertical bar to first line and continuation lines
5. Join lines with newlines and bars

### Streaming Integration

1. User input is immediately formatted with line wrapping
2. AI responses accumulate in StreamingResponse field during streaming
3. Display viewport shows real-time formatted version
4. On completion, final formatted response is added to permanent history

### Testing

- Created and tested formatWithBar() function independently
- Verified proper line wrapping with various text lengths and widths
- Built successfully with all changes integrated

## Result

The TUI now provides:
✅ Professional chat interface with vertical bars on all wrapped lines
✅ Real-time streaming of AI responses with proper formatting
✅ Consistent visual formatting for both user and AI messages
✅ Proper word-wrapping that doesn't break words mid-line
✅ Maintains all existing functionality (spinner, status, etc.)

## Files Modified

- `internal/tui/viewhelpers.go` - Added line formatting functions
- `internal/tui/model.go` - Added StreamingResponse field and initialization
- `internal/tui/commands.go` - Updated user input formatting and field initialization
- `internal/tui/model_update.go` - Enhanced streaming logic and field initialization

The implementation is complete and ready for use. The TUI now provides a professional, enterprise-grade chat experience with proper line continuation formatting.
