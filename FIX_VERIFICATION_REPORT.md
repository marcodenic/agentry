# Agentry Critical Bug Fixes - Verification Report

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Tools Appearing as Agents in UI

- **Problem**: Tool names like "echo", "ping", "read_lines" were being created as agents
- **Root Cause**: `team.Call()` method automatically created agents for unknown names
- **Solution**: Added tool name validation and agent naming conventions
- **Status**: FIXED - Tests confirm tool names are properly rejected

### 2. ✅ Duplicate Agent Responses in TUI

- **Problem**: Agent responses appeared twice in chat history
- **Root Cause**: Both token-level streaming (`tokenMsg`) and final message display (`finalMsg`) were adding the same content
- **Solution**: Disabled content addition in `tokenMsg` handler, kept only `finalMsg` for response display
- **Status**: FIXED - Token streaming disabled, only final message displays content

### 3. ✅ Deprecated Code Cleanup

- **Problem**: Multiple deprecated TUI models causing confusion and potential conflicts
- **Solution**: Removed all deprecated components
- **Files Removed**:
  - `internal/tui/chat.go` (deprecated ChatModel)
  - `internal/tui/chat_commands.go` (deprecated chat handlers)
  - `internal/tui/team.go` (deprecated TeamModel)
  - `/converse` command functionality (deprecated team conversations)

## Files Modified

### Core Fixes

- `internal/tool/manifest.go` - Added `IsBuiltinTool()` function
- `internal/converse/team.go` - Added validation in `Call()` method
- `internal/tui/model_update.go` - Fixed duplicate response handling

### Tests Added

- `internal/converse/team_test.go` - Added comprehensive validation tests

### Deprecated Code Removed

- `internal/tui/chat.go` - DELETED
- `internal/tui/chat_commands.go` - DELETED
- `internal/tui/team.go` - DELETED
- `internal/tui/commands.go` - Removed deprecated `/converse` command

## Verification Results

### Build Status

```
✅ Application builds successfully
✅ No compilation errors
✅ All deprecated code removed
✅ All dependencies resolved
```

### Test Results

```
✅ TestTeamCall - PASS
✅ TestTeamCallUnknown - PASS
✅ TestTeamAdd - PASS
✅ TestTeamCallToolNameRejection - PASS (New test)
✅ TestTeamCallInvalidNameRejection - PASS (New test)
```

### Tool Names Properly Blocked

The following tool names are now correctly rejected as agent names:

- `echo`, `ping`, `fetch`, `mcp`, `agent`
- `read_lines`, `edit_range`, `insert_at`, `search_replace`
- `get_file_info`, `view_file`, `create_file`
- `web_search`, `read_webpage`, `api_request`, `download_file`
- All shell tools: `powershell`, `cmd`, `bash`, `sh`, `patch`

### Agent Name Validation

Invalid agent names are properly rejected:

- Names starting with numbers: `123invalid`
- Empty names: `""`
- Names with special characters: `agent-with-@-symbol`
- Names with spaces: `agent with spaces`
- Names exceeding 50 characters

### Duplicate Response Fix

- ✅ `tokenMsg` handler no longer adds content to history
- ✅ `finalMsg` handler is the sole source of response display
- ✅ `agentCompleteMsg` handler only updates status
- ✅ Token counting still works for statistics

## Current State

The Agentry system now provides:

- ✅ Enterprise-grade file operation tools (atomic, cross-platform)
- ✅ Advanced web operation tools (search, requests, downloads)
- ✅ Robust agent/tool separation with proper validation
- ✅ Clean TUI experience without duplicate responses
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for critical functionality
- ✅ Clean codebase with all deprecated components removed

## Next Steps

All critical bugs have been resolved and deprecated code cleaned up. The system is ready for:

1. Continued development of additional tool phases per the roadmap
2. Further testing in production environments
3. Implementation of additional enterprise features

**Status: COMPLETED** ✅
