package tests

// This file has been refactored into focused test modules:
// - cross_platform_builtin_tools_test.go: Tests for individual builtin tools (write, view, ls, bash, edit, glob, grep, fetch)
// - cross_platform_agent_workflow_test.go: Tests for agent workflow using cross-platform tools and mock client

// The refactoring improves maintainability by separating concerns and making each test file focused on a specific area of functionality.
