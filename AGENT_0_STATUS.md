# Agentry Agent 0 Coordination Status

**Last Updated**: June 29, 2024  
**Status**: ✅ **TOOL RESTRICTION SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED**

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

Debug and validate the Agentry multi-agent system so that Agent 0 (the orchestrator) acts as a true coordinator: it must autonomously analyze user-specified tasks, discover available agents from `templates/roles/*.yaml`, and delegate subtasks to those agents—without being told which agents to use.

---

## ✅ MAJOR SUCCESS: Tool Restriction Fixed

### 🔍 Root Cause Identified
Agent 0 was receiving **all 15 tools** from the global `.agentry.yaml` configuration, completely ignoring the restrictions defined in its role-specific `templates/roles/agent_0.yaml` file. This allowed Agent 0 to bypass delegation and implement tasks directly.

### 🔧 Solution Implemented
Created `applyAgent0RoleConfig()` function in `cmd/agentry/common.go` that:
1. Loads `agent_0.yaml` after agent creation
2. Parses the `builtins` section to get allowed tools
3. Filters Agent 0's tool registry to ONLY include allowed tools
4. Applies this restriction in both `runPrompt()` and `runChatMode()`

### 📊 Validation Results
```
🔧 Before agent_0 config: agent has 15 tools
🔧 After agent_0 config: agent has 10 tools
Agent 0 tool restriction applied: 10 tools allowed
```

**Agent 0 now has ONLY coordination tools:**
- ✅ `agent` - Delegate tasks to other agents
- ✅ `team_status` - Get current status of all team agents  
- ✅ `send_message` - Send messages to other agents for coordination
- ✅ `assign_task` - Formally assign tasks with priority levels
- ✅ `check_agent` - Check if a specific agent is available
- ✅ `project_tree` - Get intelligent project structure overview
- ✅ `fileinfo` - Get comprehensive file information
- ✅ `view` - Enhanced file viewing with line numbers
- ✅ `read_lines` - Read specific lines from files
- ✅ `fetch` - Download content from URLs

**Implementation tools REMOVED:**
- ❌ `create` - File creation tool
- ❌ `edit_range` - File editing tool
- ❌ `write` - File writing tool
- ❌ `search_replace` - File modification tool

## 🧪 CURRENT STATUS

### ✅ COMPLETED
| Task | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Tool restriction | ✅ **COMPLETE** | Tools reduced from 15 → 10 |
| Implementation tools removed | ✅ **COMPLETE** | `create`, `edit_range`, `write` not available |
| Coordination tools preserved | ✅ **COMPLETE** | `agent`, `team_status`, `check_agent` available |
| Real-time logging | ✅ **COMPLETE** | Shows tool filtering process clearly |
| Role config applied | ✅ **COMPLETE** | `agent_0.yaml` now loads and applies |

### 🔄 NEXT STEPS - Delegation Testing
1. **Test Team System**: Validate Agent 0 can use `team_status` to discover agents
2. **Test Agent Discovery**: Verify `check_agent` works to confirm agent existence  
3. **Test Delegation**: Confirm Agent 0 delegates tasks using the `agent` tool
4. **Test Error Handling**: Ensure graceful handling when delegation fails

### 🚨 Known Issue
When testing delegation, encountering error: `ERR: team not found in context`
- Agent 0 has the coordination tools but team context may not be initialized properly
- Need to investigate team system initialization

## 📋 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Files Modified
- `cmd/agentry/common.go` - Added `applyAgent0RoleConfig()` and `findRoleTemplatesDir()`  
- `cmd/agentry/chat.go` - Added role config application for chat mode
- `cmd/agentry/prompt.go` - Added role config application for prompt mode
- `templates/roles/agent_0.yaml` - Already had correct tool restrictions

### Key Function
```go
func applyAgent0RoleConfig(agent *core.Agent) error {
    // Find templates/roles directory
    roleDir := findRoleTemplatesDir()
    
    // Load agent_0.yaml and parse builtins
    roleFile := filepath.Join(roleDir, "agent_0.yaml")
    // ... load and parse YAML ...
    
    // Filter tools to only allowed ones
    filteredTools := make(tool.Registry)
    for _, toolName := range config.Builtins {
        if existingTool, ok := agent.Tools[toolName]; ok {
            filteredTools[toolName] = existingTool
        }
    }
    
    // Replace agent's tool registry
    agent.Tools = filteredTools
    return nil
}
```

## 🎯 IMPACT

### Before Fix (Broken)
- Agent 0 had access to ALL 15 tools
- Could bypass delegation using direct implementation tools
- Chose the "easy path" of direct file creation/editing
- Ignored coordination workflow entirely

### After Fix (Working)
- Agent 0 has access to ONLY 10 coordination/context tools
- **Cannot bypass delegation** - no direct implementation tools available
- **Must use coordination workflow** - only path available
- **Forced to act as true coordinator** - architectural enforcement

---

## 🚀 ARCHITECTURAL VICTORY

This fix enforces the intended multi-agent architecture:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Agent 0 can only coordinate, not implement
2. **Tool-Level Security**: Restrictions enforced at the tool registry level
3. **Fail-Safe Design**: Agent 0 cannot fall back to direct implementation
4. **Clear Role Definition**: Agent 0's capabilities match its intended role

**Agent 0 is now a true orchestrator that must discover and delegate to specialist agents.**

## 🔧 TESTING

### Available Test Scripts
- `tests/coordination/` - All coordination-related test scripts
- `test_basic.sh` - Basic functionality test
- `test_chat_mode.sh` - Chat mode testing
- `test_interactive_session.sh` - Interactive session testing

### Quick Validation
```bash
# Test tool restriction
./agentry.exe "what tools do you have available?"

# Test delegation (when team system is fixed)
./agentry.exe "create a simple hello.py file"
```

---

## 📈 NEXT PHASE

**Priority**: Debug and fix the team system initialization to enable proper delegation testing.

**Goal**: Complete validation that Agent 0 successfully delegates tasks to specialist agents and acts as a true coordinator.

**Success Criteria**: Agent 0 uses `team_status` → `check_agent` → `agent` workflow to delegate tasks instead of attempting direct implementation.
