# Agentry Demos

This folder contains advanced workflow examples built with Agentry. Each demo lives in its own subdirectory and ships with a `.agentry.flow.yaml` file and README describing the scenario.

Current demos:

- **DevOps Automation** – automated planning and execution of common deployment tasks.
- **Research Assistant** – multi-step research and summarisation workflow.

Run a demo using `agentry flow <demo>` from the repo root. For example:

```bash
agentry flow agentry-demos/devops-automation
```
