# TUI Cost Display Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Cost Values "Jumping" or Being Unstable
**Root Cause**: The TUI was attempting to access removed cost caching fields (`CostStale`, `LastCostUpdate`) that no longer exist in the `AgentInfo` struct.

**Fix**: Removed all references to these fields from the token handling code:
- Removed `CostStale` field access in `model_tokens.go` (lines 110 and 180)
- Removed `LastCostUpdate` field access in `model_tokens.go` (line 109)
- Replaced cost caching logic with simple comments explaining that cost is now handled directly by the agent's cost manager

### 2. Agent 0 Model Name Display
**Root Cause**: Already fixed in previous work - Agent 0 now correctly displays the full model name.

## Current Cost Display Architecture

### Status Bar (Footer)
- **Location**: `internal/tui/view_render.go` lines 64-75
- **Logic**: Simply iterates through all agents and calls `info.Agent.Cost.TotalCost()` directly
- **No Caching**: No TUI-side cost calculation, timing, or caching

### Agent Panel
- **Location**: `internal/tui/agent_panel.go` lines 109-119
- **Logic**: Calls `ag.Agent.Cost.TotalCost()` directly for each agent
- **No Caching**: No TUI-side cost calculation, timing, or caching

## Key Changes Made

1. **Eliminated TUI-Side Cost Caching**: All cost caching fields (`CachedCost`, `LastCostUpdate`, `CostStale`) have been removed from the `AgentInfo` struct.

2. **Direct Cost Manager Access**: Both cost display locations now call the agent's cost manager directly:
   ```go
   totalCost += info.Agent.Cost.TotalCost()
   ```

3. **Removed Cost Timing Logic**: No more time-based cost staleness checking or update throttling in the TUI.

4. **Simplified Token Handling**: The token message handlers no longer attempt to manage cost state.

## Verification

- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ Budget and token tracking tests pass
- ✅ TUI initialization works correctly
- ✅ Cost display logic is now completely delegated to the agent's cost manager

## Expected Behavior

- Cost values should remain stable and only change when the underlying agent's cost manager updates them
- No more "jumping" or unstable cost displays in either the status bar or agent panel
- Cost calculations are handled entirely by the agent's cost manager, with the TUI serving only as a display layer

## Files Modified

- `/home/marco/Documents/GitHub/agentry/internal/tui/model_tokens.go` - Removed cost caching field references
- Previously modified files remain unchanged:
  - `/home/marco/Documents/GitHub/agentry/internal/tui/view_render.go` - Direct cost manager access
  - `/home/marco/Documents/GitHub/agentry/internal/tui/agent_panel.go` - Direct cost manager access
  - `/home/marco/Documents/GitHub/agentry/internal/tui/model.go` - Removed cost caching fields from AgentInfo
