## Repository Organization & Best Practices

### üìÅ **Directory Structure Guidelines**

Follow Go project best practices and keep the repository organized:

#### **Core Directories**

- `cmd/` - Main applications and entry points
- `internal/` - Private application and library code
- `pkg/` - Library code that's ok to use by external applications
- `api/` - Protocol definition files (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger specs, protocol buffers)

#### **Documentation & Examples**

- `docs/` - Documentation files
- `examples/` - Example configurations and use cases
- `templates/` - Template files for agents, teams, and roles

#### **Testing & Development**

- `tests/` - Integration tests and test utilities
- `test-programs/` - Test programs and scenarios (organized by purpose)
- `scripts/` - Build and deployment scripts
- `.github/` - GitHub workflows and templates

#### **Deployment & Packaging**

- `packaging/` - Package creation scripts (homebrew, scoop, deb)

#### **Development Tools**
- `ui/` - Web interface and frontend code
- `ts-sdk/` - TypeScript SDK

### üö´ **CRITICAL: What NEVER belongs in the root directory:**

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN IN ROOT:**

- ‚ùå ANY test files (`test_*.go`, `*_test.yaml`, `test_*.ps1`)
- ‚ùå ANY debug scripts (`debug_*.go`, `test_*.js`, `verify_*.py`)
- ‚ùå ANY temporary files (`temp_*.md`, `scratch_*.*`)
- ‚ùå ANY verification or experiment files
- ‚ùå ANY mock or example data files
- ‚ùå ANY development utilities or helper scripts

**These files WILL break the build system and MUST be placed in appropriate subdirectories:**

- `tests/` - for all test-related files
- `debug/` - for debug and troubleshooting scripts
- `examples/` - for example configurations and demos
- `test-programs/` - for test programs and scenarios
- `scripts/` - for build and utility scripts

**The root directory is SACRED and must contain only production project files.**

### ‚úÖ **Proper places for test files:**

- **Unit tests**: Place `*_test.go` files next to the code they test
- **Integration tests**: Use `tests/` directory with descriptive subdirectories
- **Test configurations**: Use `tests/configs/` or `examples/`
- **Test programs**: Use `test-programs/` with clear naming

### üìù **File Naming Conventions**

- Use kebab-case for YAML/config files: `agent-config.yaml`
- Use snake_case for Go files: `agent_test.go`
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose: `integration_test.go`, `benchmark_test.go`
- Avoid generic names like `test.go`, `debug.go`, `temp.yaml`

### üßπ **Repository Cleanup Guidelines**

- **Test files**: Always place test files in appropriate directories (`tests/`, `test-programs/`)
- **Configurations**: Store test configurations in `tests/configs/` or `examples/`
- **Debug artifacts**: Remove debug files immediately after use
- **Temporary files**: Never commit temporary or experimental files to the repository

### üõ† **Cross-Platform Development Notes**

- **Windows PowerShell**: Use full path `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` in Go code
- **Command translation**: Unix commands are automatically translated to PowerShell on Windows
- **Path separators**: Use `filepath.Join()` for cross-platform path handling
- **Shell execution**: Prefer `sbox.ExecDirect()` with proper OS detection

## Project Vision

Agentry is a minimal, extensible agentic runtime written in Go, with a TypeScript SDK. The project aims to provide a robust platform for building, orchestrating, and scaling multi-agent AI systems. See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for strategic direction and future plans.

## üö® MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION UPDATES

**CRITICAL: When ANY work is completed, you MUST update the following files immediately:**

### ‚úÖ REQUIRED ACTIONS AFTER COMPLETING WORK:

1. **Update [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)**

   - Mark completed tasks as DONE
   - Remove or update obsolete items
   - Add any new tasks discovered during work
   - Update progress indicators and timelines

2. **Update Documentation**

   - Update relevant files in `/docs/` directory
   - Update API documentation if APIs changed
   - Update usage examples if functionality changed
   - Update installation/setup instructions if needed

3. **Update TODO Lists**

   - Remove completed items from any TODO lists
   - Add new discovered tasks or technical debt
   - Update priorities based on current understanding

4. **Update This File (AGENTS.md)**
   - Add new agents/entrypoints if created
   - Update examples if changed
   - Update testing instructions if new tests added

### üéØ PURPOSE:

- **Prevent Duplicate Work**: Agents need current information to avoid repeating completed tasks
- **Maintain Accurate Backlog**: Keep the work queue current and prioritized
- **Enable Efficient Collaboration**: Ensure all agents have up-to-date context

### ‚ö†Ô∏è FAILURE TO UPDATE DOCUMENTATION WILL RESULT IN:

- Wasted effort on already-completed tasks
- Inconsistent project state
- Confused agents working from outdated information
- Degraded project quality and efficiency

**NO EXCEPTIONS: Documentation updates are not optional‚Äîthey are a required part of completing any work.**

## üéØ Advanced File Operations

Agentry includes VS Code-level file editing capabilities through advanced builtin tools that provide atomic, line-precise, and cross-platform file operations:

### ‚úÖ Available File Operation Tools

- **`read_lines`** - Read specific lines from files with line-precise access
- **`edit_range`** - Replace a range of lines atomically (no shell commands needed)
- **`insert_at`** - Insert lines at specific positions with atomic writes
- **`search_replace`** - Advanced search and replace with regex support
- **`fileinfo`** - Comprehensive file analysis (size, lines, encoding, type detection)
- **`view`** - Enhanced file viewing with line numbers and syntax awareness
- **`create`** - Create new files with built-in overwrite protection

### üîß Technical Features

- **Atomic Operations**: All edits use temporary files and atomic moves
- **Cross-Platform**: Pure Go implementation, no shell dependencies
- **Line-Precise**: Edit specific lines without affecting the rest of the file
- **Safety First**: Built-in overwrite protection and file modification tracking
- **JSON Results**: All tools return structured JSON with operation metadata

### üìñ Usage Example

```yaml
tools:
  - name: read_lines
    type: builtin
  - name: edit_range
    type: builtin
  - name: search_replace
    type: builtin
```

Agents can use these tools for sophisticated code editing:

```bash
# Read lines 10-20 from a Go file
agentry call read_lines '{"path": "main.go", "start_line": 10, "end_line": 20}'

# Atomically replace lines 15-17 with new implementation
agentry call edit_range '{"path": "main.go", "start_line": 15, "end_line": 17, "content": "// New code here"}'

# Use regex to refactor function calls across a file
agentry call search_replace '{"path": "main.go", "search": "fmt\\.Println\\(([^)]+)\\)", "replace": "log.Println($1)", "regex": true}'
```

These tools make Agentry's code editing capabilities comparable to VS Code, enabling agents to perform precise, professional-grade file modifications.
