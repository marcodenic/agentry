# Agentry Enhanced Context & Coordination Roadmap

## 🎯 **Vision: Agent 0 as Smart as VSCode/OpenCode**

Based on our successful natural language coordination foundation, we're now enhancing Agent 0 to have IDE-level context awareness and coordination capabilities.

### **Benchmarks: VSCode/OpenCode Capabilities**
- 🔍 **Workspace Understanding**: Full project structure awareness
- 📁 **Smart File Trees**: Multi-level structure ignoring package folders
- 🧠 **Context Intelligence**: Understanding project type, dependencies, patterns
- 🔧 **LSP-like Capabilities**: Code analysis, symbol understanding, relationships
- 🤖 **Intelligent Delegation**: Context-aware task assignment

---

## 🎯 **CURRENT STATUS: Foundation Complete - Ready for Advanced Development**

### ✅ **COMPLETED PHASE 1: Enhanced Context Foundation**
**Completion Date**: June 29, 2025
**Status**: **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

**🌟 Major Achievements:**
- ✅ **`project_tree` tool**: Implemented and working perfectly
- ✅ **Smart filtering**: Ignores common folders (node_modules, .git, etc.)
- ✅ **VSCode-level context**: File type detection with emojis
- ✅ **Tool integration**: 15 tools available (5 new context/coordination tools)
- ✅ **Agent 0 enhancement**: Context-aware workflow implemented

**� Implementation Details:**
- Added `project_tree` builtin tool to `internal/tool/builtins.go`
- Enhanced `.agentry.yaml` with new tool configurations
- Updated Agent 0 prompt with context-gathering workflow
- Integrated team coordination tools (`team_status`, `send_message`, etc.)

### 🎯 **CURRENT CHALLENGE: Delegation Success Rate Optimization**

**Current Performance:**
- � **Tool Usage**: Excellent (6-9 tools per complex request)
- � **Context Awareness**: Available but needs prompting optimization
- 🤖 **Coordination Attempts**: Working but needs refinement
- � **Agent Spawning**: 33% success rate (target: 80%+)

**Key Insight**: Agent 0 has all the tools and context but needs better prompt engineering to consistently use context and delegate appropriately.

## 📋 **Phase 2: Smart Coordination Enhancement (Priority 2)**

### **2.1 Context-Aware Delegation**
**Goal**: Agent 0 uses full context for smarter task assignment

**Enhanced Decision Making**:
```yaml
# Agent 0 enhanced decision process:
1. analyze_project          # Understand project context
2. project_tree depth=2     # Get structure overview  
3. code_summary <target>    # Understand specific files
4. team_status              # Check agent availability
5. Intelligent delegation based on full context
```

**Smart Delegation Examples**:
- **Code Review Request** → Analyze code, find related tests, delegate to `coder` with full context
- **Testing Request** → Find source files, understand structure, delegate to `tester` with patterns
- **Documentation Request** → Analyze project scope, existing docs, delegate to `writer` with context

### **2.2 Enhanced Agent Prompts**
**Goal**: Each specialist agent gets rich context

**Context Package for Agents**:
```yaml
# When delegating, Agent 0 provides:
context_package:
  project_info: "Go web service, REST API, Docker deployment"
  file_tree: "Relevant project structure"
  related_files: "Connected files for task"
  task_context: "Specific background and requirements"
  coordination_notes: "How this fits with other agents' work"
```

### **2.3 Conflict Prevention System**
**Goal**: Prevent agents from conflicting work

**Implementation**:
- 📋 **Work Registry**: Track which agents are working on which files
- 🔒 **File Locking**: Prevent simultaneous edits
- 📞 **Agent Communication**: Coordinate between agents on related tasks
- ⚡ **Smart Sequencing**: Order tasks to prevent conflicts

---

## 📋 **Phase 3: Core Task Capabilities (Priority 3)**

### **3.1 Code Review Excellence**
**Goal**: Professional-level code review capability

**Agent 0 Code Review Workflow**:
1. `analyze_project` → Understand codebase context
2. `project_tree` → Get structural overview
3. `code_summary <files>` → Understand code purpose
4. `find_related <files>` → Find tests, dependencies
5. Delegate to `coder` with comprehensive context
6. `analyst` for metrics/patterns if needed

**Coder Agent Enhancements**:
- Code quality analysis tools
- Security pattern detection  
- Performance consideration checks
- Best practice validation
- Test coverage analysis

### **3.2 Planning Task Mastery**
**Goal**: Project planning as good as senior developers

**Agent 0 Planning Workflow**:
1. Full project context analysis
2. Identify dependencies and constraints
3. Break down complex tasks
4. Delegate planning to `planner` with context
5. Coordinate with other agents for feasibility

**Planner Agent Capabilities**:
- Task breakdown and estimation
- Dependency mapping
- Risk assessment
- Timeline planning
- Resource coordination

### **3.3 Smart File Operations**
**Goal**: Context-aware file creation and modification

**Enhanced File Operations**:
- **Template-aware creation**: Understand project patterns for new files
- **Consistent styling**: Match existing code style and structure
- **Import management**: Automatically handle dependencies
- **Test file generation**: Create corresponding test structure

## 🛠️ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)**

### **Step 1: Optimize Agent 0 Delegation Prompting (Week 1)**
**Goal**: Increase delegation success rate from 33% to 80%+

**Actions**:
- [ ] Enhance Agent 0 prompt with explicit context-first workflow
- [ ] Add delegation decision tree: when to delegate vs. handle directly
