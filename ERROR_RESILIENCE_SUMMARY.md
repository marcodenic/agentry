# Agentry Error Resilience Enhancement

## Summary

Agentry has been significantly improved to handle errors gracefully instead of immediately terminating interactions when tools or agents encounter failures. This makes the system much more robust and suitable for real-world usage.

## Key Changes

### 1. Core Agent Error Handling (`internal/core/agent.go`)

**Before:** Tool errors immediately terminated agent execution with `return "", err`

**After:** Tool errors are now treated as recoverable feedback:
- Errors are returned as tool results that agents can see and respond to
- Agents continue execution loop after receiving error feedback
- Configurable retry limits prevent infinite error loops
- Detailed error context helps agents understand what went wrong

### 2. Error Handling Configuration

Added `ErrorHandlingConfig` struct to the `Agent` type:

```go
type ErrorHandlingConfig struct {
    TreatErrorsAsResults bool // Makes tool errors visible to agent instead of terminating
    MaxErrorRetries      int  // Limits consecutive errors before stopping
    IncludeErrorContext  bool // Adds detailed error context for better recovery
}
```

**Default Configuration:**
- `TreatErrorsAsResults: true` - Errors become feedback instead of failures
- `MaxErrorRetries: 3` - Allow up to 3 consecutive errors
- `IncludeErrorContext: true` - Provide detailed error information

### 3. Team Delegation Resilience (`internal/team/team.go`)

**Before:** Agent delegation failures were propagated as errors to parent agents

**After:** Delegation failures are returned as helpful feedback:
- Error messages include suggestions for alternative approaches
- Parent agents can try different delegation strategies
- Maintains delegation context for better debugging

### 4. Enhanced Error Messages

Error messages now include:
- Context about what tool failed and why
- Suggestions for alternative approaches
- Available tools information when unknown tools are called
- Detailed stack traces when enabled

## Example Error Recovery Flow

### Old Behavior:
1. Agent tries non-existent tool â†’ **IMMEDIATE TERMINATION**

### New Behavior:
1. Agent tries non-existent tool
2. Receives error feedback: "Error: Unknown tool 'xyz'. Available tools: [list]"
3. Agent sees error message and tries alternative approach
4. Agent successfully completes task using correct tools

## Configuration Example

```go
// Enable error resilience (default)
agent.ErrorHandling.TreatErrorsAsResults = true
agent.ErrorHandling.MaxErrorRetries = 3
agent.ErrorHandling.IncludeErrorContext = true

// Disable for old behavior (not recommended)
agent.ErrorHandling.TreatErrorsAsResults = false
```

## Testing

Added comprehensive tests in `tests/error_resilience_test.go`:

- `TestErrorHandlingWithNonResilientAgent` - Verifies old behavior still available
- `TestErrorHandlingWithResilientAgent` - Demonstrates recovery from errors
- `TestErrorHandlingTooManyErrors` - Verifies retry limits work

## Benefits

1. **Increased Robustness**: Agents can recover from tool failures and try alternatives
2. **Better Multi-Agent Workflows**: Delegation failures don't crash entire workflows
3. **Improved Debugging**: Detailed error context helps identify and fix issues
4. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating even when components fail
5. **Configurable Resilience**: Different resilience levels for different use cases

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing functionality preserved
- Error resilience is enabled by default but configurable
- Existing tests updated to work with new behavior
- Old error handling behavior still available via configuration

## Files Modified

- `internal/core/agent.go` - Core error handling improvements
- `internal/team/team.go` - Delegation error resilience
- `cmd/agentry/agent.go` - Default error handling configuration
- `tests/error_resilience_test.go` - Comprehensive error handling tests
- `tests/agent_0_debug_test.go` - Updated for new behavior

This enhancement makes Agentry significantly more suitable for production use where robustness and error recovery are critical.
