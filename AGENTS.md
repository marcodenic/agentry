# AGENTS.md

> **Looking for the high-level roadmap, strategic context, or upcoming features?**
> See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) in the project root. ROADMAP.md contains the master plan, forward-looking goals, and detailed roadmap for Agentry Cloud‚Äîincluding persistent memory, workflow orchestration, sandboxing, distributed scheduling, and more.

## Project Vision

Agentry is a minimal, extensible agentic runtime written in Go, with a TypeScript SDK. The project aims to provide a robust platform for building, orchestrating, and scaling multi-agent AI systems. See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for strategic direction and future plans.

## üö® MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION UPDATES

**CRITICAL: When ANY work is completed, you MUST update the following files immediately:**

### ‚úÖ REQUIRED ACTIONS AFTER COMPLETING WORK:

1. **Update [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)**

   - Mark completed tasks as DONE
   - Remove or update obsolete items
   - Add any new tasks discovered during work
   - Update progress indicators and timelines

2. **Update Documentation**

   - Update relevant files in `/docs/` directory
   - Update API documentation if APIs changed
   - Update usage examples if functionality changed
   - Update installation/setup instructions if needed

3. **Update TODO Lists**

   - Remove completed items from any TODO lists
   - Add new discovered tasks or technical debt
   - Update priorities based on current understanding

4. **Update This File (AGENTS.md)**
   - Add new agents/entrypoints if created
   - Update examples if changed
   - Update testing instructions if new tests added

### üéØ PURPOSE:

- **Prevent Duplicate Work**: Agents need current information to avoid repeating completed tasks
- **Maintain Accurate Backlog**: Keep the work queue current and prioritized
- **Enable Efficient Collaboration**: Ensure all agents have up-to-date context

### ‚ö†Ô∏è FAILURE TO UPDATE DOCUMENTATION WILL RESULT IN:

- Wasted effort on already-completed tasks
- Inconsistent project state
- Confused agents working from outdated information
- Degraded project quality and efficiency

**NO EXCEPTIONS: Documentation updates are not optional‚Äîthey are a required part of completing any work.**

## üìã ROADMAP & DOCUMENTATION UPDATE POLICY

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**

- **ONLY** mark tasks as complete in [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) when they have been implemented to an **enterprise-grade level** with proper testing, documentation, and error handling
- **ALWAYS** review and update the roadmap immediately after making ANY changes to the codebase
- **ALWAYS** update relevant documentation when creating or modifying features
- **NEVER** leave partial or experimental implementations marked as complete
- **VERIFY** that all related documentation accurately reflects the current state after your changes

**This is not a suggestion‚Äîit is a requirement for all contributors and agents.**

_Please help keep this file up to date as agents and entrypoints are added or removed._
