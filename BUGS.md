1. content in the output is eventually truncated ...[earlier messages truncated]... ... it shouldnt be.
2. i would like to be able to push up in the input and iterate through previous messages sent.. eg, so i can push up arrow on my keyboard and the input populates with my last sent message, and if i hit up again i get the second last sent message etc etc
3. i would like the text input to grow as user input grows beyond a single line. users should be able to see their whole text content in the input.
4. while typing in the input, sometimes the text content visible in the history moves up and down a little bit. that should not happen.
