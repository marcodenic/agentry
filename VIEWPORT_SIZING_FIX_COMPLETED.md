# Viewport Sizing and Scrolling Fix - Completed

## Problem

The chat content viewport was not properly filling the available screen space, causing content to scroll off-screen and preventing users from seeing the full conversation history.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Incorrect Height Calculation**: The viewport height calculation was not accounting for all UI elements properly
2. **Lipgloss Width Constraints**: SetContent calls were wrapping content in lipgloss styles with width constraints, interfering with the viewport's internal scrolling mechanism
3. **Double Styling**: Content was being styled both in the viewport and in the View() function, causing layout conflicts

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Viewport Sizing Logic ✅

**File**: `internal/tui/model_update.go`

- **Improved height calculation**: Changed from `msg.Height - 4` to `msg.Height - 5` to account for all UI elements
- **Better width calculation**: Ensured chat area uses exactly 75% of available width
- **Added bottom positioning**: Viewport now properly goes to bottom after resize

```go
// Calculate viewport height more accurately:
// Total height - top section margin - horizontal separator (1) - input section height - footer section height - padding
viewportHeight := msg.Height - 5  // Leave space for separator, input, footer, and padding

m.vp.Width = chatWidth
m.vp.Height = viewportHeight
```

### 2. Removed Interfering Lipgloss Styling ✅

**Files**: `internal/tui/model_update.go`, `internal/tui/commands.go`

- **Removed width constraints**: All `m.vp.SetContent()` calls now pass content directly without lipgloss width wrapping
- **Eliminated double styling**: Let the viewport handle its own content rendering instead of pre-styling with lipgloss
- **Preserved scrolling behavior**: Viewport can now manage its content properly

**Before**:

```go
base := lipgloss.NewStyle().Foreground(lipgloss.Color(m.theme.Palette.Foreground))
m.vp.SetContent(base.Copy().Width(m.vp.Width).Render(info.History))
```

**After**:

```go
m.vp.SetContent(info.History)
```

### 3. Fixed View Function Layout ✅

**File**: `internal/tui/model_update.go`

- **Direct viewport rendering**: `chatContent = m.vp.View()` lets viewport handle its own content
- **Preserved logo centering**: Special case handling for initial logo display
- **Clean layout structure**: Proper vertical stacking of UI elements

## Files Modified

- `internal/tui/model_update.go` - Core viewport sizing and content setting
- `internal/tui/commands.go` - Agent switching and content updates

## Changes Made

1. **Window Resize Handler**: Improved viewport height/width calculations
2. **Content Setting**: Removed all lipgloss width constraints from SetContent calls
3. **View Rendering**: Simplified viewport content rendering
4. **Agent Switching**: Fixed content display when switching between agents

## Impact

- **✅ Full Screen Usage**: Chat content now fills the entire available chat area
- **✅ Proper Scrolling**: Users can scroll through full conversation history
- **✅ No Content Loss**: All messages remain visible and accessible
- **✅ Responsive Layout**: Viewport properly resizes with terminal window
- **✅ Better UX**: Users can now see complete interactions for screenshots and testing

## Testing Verification

The fix addresses the original issue where:

- Content was scrolling off-screen ❌ → Now properly contained within viewport ✅
- Chat area wasn't using full available space ❌ → Now uses full 75% width and calculated height ✅
- Scrolling was broken ❌ → Now works properly with viewport's internal scrolling ✅

Users can now:

1. See full conversation history by scrolling up/down
2. Take complete screenshots of interactions
3. Have confidence that no content is lost off-screen
4. Experience proper terminal resizing behavior

This fix provides the foundation for proper testing and demonstration of the TUI improvements.
