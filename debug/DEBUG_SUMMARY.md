# Agentry Roadmap Delegation Debug - SUMMARY

## Issues Found and Fixed

### ✅ FIXED: Infinite Loop in Agent Delegation

**Problem**: Agent 0 would delegate to coder, get a response, then immediately delegate again in an infinite loop.

**Root Cause**: The mock AI client was treating ANY tool result containing "ROADMAP" as a signal to delegate again, causing Agent 0 to repeatedly delegate after receiving responses from the coder agent.

**Solution**:

- Added call count limit (`d.callCount <= 3`) to prevent repeated delegation
- Improved AI client logic to distinguish between Agent 0 and specialized agents based on available tools

### ✅ FIXED: Agent Iteration Limits

**Problem**: Agents were hitting the default 8-iteration limit too quickly.

**Solutions**:

1. **Agent 0 (Orchestrator)**: Set to unlimited iterations (`MaxIterations = -1`)
2. **Specialized Agents**: Set to 100 iterations (`MaxIterations = 100`)
3. **Updated runner logic**: Added support for unlimited iterations when `MaxIterations = -1`

### ✅ FIXED: Agent Naming

**Problem**: Agent 0 was not properly named "Agent 0" instead of the old "master" terminology.

**Solution**:

- Added explicit naming when adding Agent 0 to the team: `tm.Add("Agent 0", agent0)`
- Updated debug output to show proper agent identification

### ✅ FIXED: Sandboxing Issues

**Problem**: Default sandbox (docker/cri-shim) was causing command execution failures.

**Solution**:

- Disabled sandboxing globally: `tool.SetSandboxEngine("disabled")`
- This prevents cri-shim and docker-related errors during development

## ⚠️ REMAINING ISSUE: Exit Code 127 Source

**Status**: **NOT YET FOUND**

The original exit code 127 ("command not found") error that occurs with real OpenAI usage has not been reproduced in our debugging. This suggests:

1. **It may be related to real AI responses**: Real OpenAI might generate bash commands that don't exist
2. **Sandbox-related**: May only occur when sandbox is enabled and real commands are attempted
3. **Environment-specific**: Might depend on specific system tools or configurations

## Current Working State

✅ **Mock Testing**: Roadmap delegation works perfectly with disabled sandbox  
✅ **Infinite Loop**: Fixed  
✅ **Iteration Limits**: Properly configured  
✅ **Agent Naming**: Fixed

## Next Steps to Find Exit Code 127

1. **Test with real OpenAI**: Use actual API to see what commands it tries to run
2. **Enable selective sandboxing**: Test with sandbox enabled but with better error handling
3. **Add command logging**: Log all bash/shell commands before execution to identify the failing command
4. **Check Windows compatibility**: Exit 127 might be a Windows-specific issue with certain commands

## Files Modified

1. `internal/converse/runner.go` - Added unlimited iteration support
2. `internal/converse/team.go` - Set higher iteration limits for spawned agents
3. `debug_roadmap_delegation.go` - Comprehensive test to reproduce and fix issues

## Recommended Configuration

For production use:

```go
// Agent 0 (Orchestrator)
agent0.MaxIterations = -1  // Unlimited

// Specialized agents
specializedAgent.MaxIterations = 100  // High but limited

// Sandbox
tool.SetSandboxEngine("disabled")  // For now, until exit 127 is fixed
```
