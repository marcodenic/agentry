# TUI Unification - COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully unified and modernized the Agentry TUI to use a single, advanced, and consistent interface for both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. The unified TUI now provides a btop-style agent panel and optimal terminal usage as specified in the TUI implementation plan.

## Major Changes

### 1. Unified Model (model.go)
- **Primary Interface**: Made `Model` the single source of truth for all TUI scenarios
- **Advanced Agent Panel**: Implemented btop-style panel with:
  - ü§ñ Panel title with emoji
  - Summary stats (Total agents, Running count)
  - Agent index display `[0]`, `[1]`, etc.
  - Active agent indicator `‚ñ∂`
  - Enhanced status dots: `‚óè` idle, `üü°` running, `‚ùå` error, `‚è∏Ô∏è` stopped
  - Role display with color coding
  - Current tool display with icon (üîß)
  - Model name display
  - Token count with percentage
  - Progress bars for token usage
  - Activity sparklines for token history
  - Cost information display
  - Control hints at bottom

### 2. Enhanced Navigation
- **Multiple Key Bindings**: Added support for ‚Üê‚Üí, ‚Üë‚Üì, Ctrl+P/N for agent cycling
- **Jump Navigation**: Added Home/End and Ctrl+A/E for first/last agent
- **Better UX**: Added jumpToAgent method for direct navigation

### 3. Deprecated Legacy Models
- **ChatModel (chat.go)**: Marked as deprecated with comprehensive migration guidance
- **TeamModel (team.go)**: Marked as deprecated with clear deprecation warnings
- **Clear Migration Path**: Documented how to migrate from legacy models to unified Model

### 4. Updated Main Interface (main.go)
- **Unified Entry Point**: Already using `tui.New()` for all scenarios
- **Full-Screen Mode**: Launches with `tea.WithAltScreen()` for immersive experience
- **Team Support**: Team mode handled through `/spawn` and `/converse` commands

### 5. Enhanced Commands and Help
- **Improved Help**: More comprehensive help text with command descriptions
- **Role Support**: `/spawn <name> [role]` command supports agent roles
- **Consistent Commands**: All agent management through unified command interface

### 6. Visual Improvements
- **No Empty Space**: Optimized viewport sizing for full terminal usage
- **Consistent Styling**: All components use theme colors properly
- **Professional Layout**: Clean 75/25 split between chat and agent panel
- **Status Bar**: Comprehensive status information at bottom

### 7. Test Updates
- **Snapshot Tests**: Updated theme snapshots to reflect new design
- **Integration Tests**: Updated agent tool test to use unified Model
- **All Tests Passing**: Full test suite compatibility maintained

## Benefits of Unification

1. **Consistency**: Single interface for all agent scenarios
2. **Maintainability**: Reduced code duplication and complexity
3. **Performance**: Optimized rendering and state management
4. **User Experience**: Modern, intuitive interface with advanced features
5. **Future-Proof**: Easier to extend with new features
6. **Documentation**: Clear migration path for existing code

## Files Modified

- `internal/tui/model.go` - Enhanced with advanced agent panel and navigation
- `internal/tui/chat.go` - Deprecated with migration guidance
- `internal/tui/team.go` - Deprecated with migration guidance  
- `internal/tui/nokeys.go` - Enhanced key bindings
- `internal/tui/theme.go` - Added new theme colors for roles, tools, panel titles
- `cmd/agentry/main.go` - Already using unified interface
- `tests/tui_agent_tool_test.go` - Updated to use unified Model
- Theme snapshot tests - Updated to reflect new design

## Migration Guide

**Old approach:**
```go
// Legacy team model
model, err := tui.NewTeam(agent, 3, "topic")
// or
model, err := tui.NewChat(agent, 3, "topic")
```

**New unified approach:**
```go
// Unified model for all scenarios
model := tui.New(agent)
// Use /spawn commands to create additional agents
// Use /converse command for team conversations
```

## Verification

- ‚úÖ TUI launches correctly with advanced agent panel
- ‚úÖ All navigation keys work (‚Üê‚Üí‚Üë‚Üì, Ctrl+P/N, Home/End, Ctrl+A/E)
- ‚úÖ Agent spawning works via `/spawn <name> [role]` 
- ‚úÖ Role display and color coding functional
- ‚úÖ Token tracking and progress bars working
- ‚úÖ Activity sparklines displaying correctly
- ‚úÖ Status indicators showing proper states
- ‚úÖ Full terminal space utilization
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- ‚úÖ Snapshot tests updated
- ‚úÖ Legacy code clearly marked as deprecated

The TUI is now fully unified and provides a modern, consistent, and advanced interface for all Agentry scenarios.
