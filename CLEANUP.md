# üßπ Agentry Codebase Cleanup & Simplification Plan

*Generated: 24 August 2025*  
*Status: In Progress*

## üéØ **OVERVIEW**

This document tracks the comprehensive cleanup and simplification of the Agentry codebase. The goal is to reduce technical debt, eliminate dead code, and simplify complex systems while maintaining all existing functionality.

**Critical Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ All core workflows must continue to work: `agentry "hi"`, TUI mode, system reports
- ‚úÖ Agent delegation and spawning (e.g., "spawn coder to review PRODUCT.md") must work
- ‚úÖ All existing tests must pass
- ‚úÖ CLI improvements and quote-free prompts must be preserved

  - [ ] Update it to handle both role-based and ad-hoc agent creation
  - [ ] Add proper role resolution and fallback logic

- [ ] Remove redundant methods
  - [ ] Remove or deprecate unused creation methods
  - [ ] Update all callers to use unified path
  - [ ] Update tests to use new unified approach

### **C. Role Configuration System Simplification**

**Current Problem:** Multiple overlapping role loading systems

**Unification Tasks:**

  - [ ] Implement clear fallback chain: YAML file ‚Üí default template ‚Üí hardcoded fallback
  - [ ] Ensure consistent model selection logic

- [ ] Expose available roles to Agent 0
  - [ ] Fix the core issue where Agent 0 can't see available roles
  - [ ] Update `team_status` and `check_agent` tools to show roles vs spawned agents
  - [ ] Test that delegation works properly with role awareness

---

## üìã **PRIORITY 4: TESTING & QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS**

### **A. Test File Organization**

**Cleanup Tasks:**
- [ ] Remove redundant test files
  - [ ] `rm tests/bash-tool/direct-test.go` (not a proper Go test)
  - [ ] `rm tests/simple_smoke_test.go` (too simple, covered elsewhere)

- [ ] Consolidate cross-platform test files
  - [ ] Review `tests/cross_platform_*.go` files for consolidation opportunities
  - [ ] Merge duplicated test logic where possible

### **B. Test Mock Consolidation**

**Current Issue:** Multiple similar mock clients in tests

**Consolidation Tasks:**
- [ ] Create shared test utilities
  - [ ] Extract common mock patterns from:
    - `delegationMockClient`, `mockAgent0Client`, `loopMock`
    - `realCoderMockClient`, `writerMockClient`, `coderMockClient`
  - [ ] Create reusable test helpers in `tests/helpers/`

- [ ] Update tests to use shared mocks
  - [ ] Refactor tests to use consolidated mock utilities
  - [ ] Remove duplicate mock implementations
  - [ ] Ensure all tests still pass with shared mocks

### **C. Test Coverage Validation**

**Validation Tasks:**
- [ ] Verify core workflows after each cleanup phase
  - [ ] Test: `agentry "hi"` (direct prompt)
  - [ ] Test: `agentry chat "hello there"` (chat mode)
  - [ ] Test: `agentry tui` (TUI interface)
  - [ ] Test: Complex delegation like "spawn coder to review PRODUCT.md"

- [ ] Run full test suite after major changes
  - [ ] `go test ./...` must pass
  - [ ] No regression in agent delegation functionality
  - [ ] TUI rendering must work correctly

## üìã **PRIORITY 5: BUG FIXES & POLISH**

### **A. Known TUI Issues**

**Bug Fix Tasks:**

  - [ ] Investigate terminal display handling in `internal/tui/model_layout.go`
  - [ ] Ensure proper escape sequence handling
  - [ ] Test resize behavior across different terminals

- [ ] Implement missing OpenAI/Anthropic reasoning_effort support
  - [ ] Add reasoning_effort parameter to model calls
  - [ ] Update `internal/model/` to support reasoning effort
  - [ ] Test with latest OpenAI/Anthropic models

### **B. Environment Variable Cleanup**

**Scope Reduction Tasks:**
- [ ] Audit all `os.Setenv()` calls
  - [ ] Review 20+ current calls in codebase
  - [ ] Determine which are necessary vs. legacy
  - [ ] Consolidate or remove unnecessary environment variable setting

- [ ] Improve environment variable documentation
  - [ ] Update PRODUCT.md environment variable section
  - [ ] Document which variables are user-facing vs. internal
  - [ ] Provide migration guide for deprecated variables

## üß™ **TESTING CHECKPOINTS**

After each priority phase, run these validation tests:

### **Core Functionality Tests:**
```bash
# Basic functionality
./agentry "hi"
./agentry "what's the weather like?"
./agentry chat "hello there"

# Agent delegation
./agentry "spawn a coder to review PRODUCT.md and suggest improvements"
./agentry "create a system report of this project"

# TUI functionality
./agentry tui  # Should start without errors
# Test resize, navigation, agent panel
```

### **Technical Tests:**
```bash
# Build and test suite
go build ./cmd/agentry
go test ./...
go vet ./...

# CLI flag tests
./agentry --debug "quick test"
./agentry --help
./agentry --version
```

### **Regression Prevention:**
- [ ] All existing config files must still work
- [ ] Environment variables must maintain backward compatibility during transition
- [ ] TUI themes and display must remain functional
- [ ] Agent delegation and coordination must work correctly
