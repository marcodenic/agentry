# Testing Duplicate Response Fix

## Root Cause Analysis (UPDATED)

The duplicate response issue was caused by **TWO different systems both adding the same content to the chat history**:

1. **Token-level streaming** (`tokenMsg` handler)

   - Individual characters were being added via `info.History += msg.token`
   - This built up the complete response character by character
   - This was happening WITHOUT any formatting (no AI bar)

2. **Final message display** (`finalMsg` handler)
   - The complete response was added again via `finalMsg`
   - This added the response WITH proper formatting (AI bar)

## Result

The chat would show:

```
Hey. What do you need?Hey. What do you need?
```

Or in some cases:

```
Hey. What do you need?ðŸ¤– Hey. What do you need?
```

## Fix Applied

**1. Disabled content addition in `tokenMsg` handler:**

- Removed `info.History += msg.token`
- Kept token counting for statistics
- Let `finalMsg` be the sole handler for content display

**2. Ensured `agentCompleteMsg` only handles status:**

- Only updates `info.Status = StatusIdle`
- Does NOT add any content to history

**3. Removed deprecated TUI components:**

- Deleted `internal/tui/chat.go` (deprecated ChatModel)
- Deleted `internal/tui/chat_commands.go` (deprecated handlers)

## Expected Result

- âœ… Agent responses appear exactly once in chat history
- âœ… Proper formatting with AI bar indicator
- âœ… Token counting still works for statistics
- âœ… No duplicate content from any source
